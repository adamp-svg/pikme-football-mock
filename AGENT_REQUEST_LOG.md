# Agent Request Log — Football Game

## 2026-07-23

- **Season badge (agent-82027)** — User: "change season badge to 1". Changed `#hub-season` in public/index.html `עונה 2` → `עונה 1` (index.html:36). Verified live: :3012 serves `class="hub-season">עונה 1`. Committed as **1f2a3d3**.
  - ⚠️ COLLISION (again): index.html had another agent's UNCOMMITTED `#party` screen (Play-With-Friends step-2 roster, ~33 lines, `class="screen hidden"`). My pathspec `git commit public/index.html` swept it into 1f2a3d3 alongside the 1-line season change. It's a hidden screen → zero runtime harm, and fully preserved in history. Could NOT cleanly split it back out: another agent committed 647732d on top of 1f2a3d3 within seconds → would need a shared-branch rebase (blocked + risky), so left intact. **#party author: your scaffold is committed in 1f2a3d3, not lost — your working tree may now show clean for that block.**
  - Lesson for all: pathspec `git commit <file>` still commits the WHOLE file incl. others' uncommitted edits. Lock the file or coordinate before committing shared files.

- **Req #7** — Task (continuation, same lock `football-mock:hero-rank-badge`). (a) Make both badges a bit smaller; (b) render the hero IN FRONT of the hero badge (`#hub-tier` was z6, over the hero's face — user wants the hero over the badge, badge peeking from behind).
  - Impl (style.css only): both badges 60×50 → 50×42; shrank `.px-ic` 22→18px, text 10→9px, padding 4→3px, hero padding-bottom 9→8px + bar inset. Baked pos: `#hub-rank` left 283 width 50 (re-centred on worth-chip centre x308), `#hub-tier` left 590 width 50, **z-index 6→3** (hero `.hub-hero` is z4 → now paints over the badge).
  - Verified: :3010 serves both at 50×42; `#hub-rank` centre 283+25=308 == `#chip-worth` centre 278+30=308 (aligned); `#hub-tier` z3 < hero z4 (hero in front). Committed locally (not pushed — user rule = local + commit).
  - Status: DONE

- **Review + Push (agent-82027)** — User: "review all agents + stuff feeding localhost:3012, commit & push whatever you can."
  - Found: working tree effectively clean (all agents had committed their work); only in-flight file was `public/style.css`, **actively locked by opus-football** — left untouched, did NOT sweep it into a commit.
  - Action: pushed `feat/build-bomb-cancel` to origin. Clean fast-forward `95d2f9e → 87e9ab7` (15 commits: hero-drag log, lobby sub-screens/rank badges, cards page peek/pull/sleeves/2x slots, field-builder). Verified `origin/feat/build-bomb-cancel == 87e9ab7`.
  - Note for next agent: remember to `git push origin feat/build-bomb-cancel` after committing — the branch had accumulated 15 unpushed commits. Only origin exists (github adamp-svg/pikme-football-mock); no `main` merge attempted.

- **Req #6** — Task (continuation, same lock). (a) Move the cards/collector badge `#hub-rank` to align directly with the worth chip `#chip-worth`; (b) make `#hub-rank` + hero `#hub-tier` the SAME dimensions — a squarish, slightly-longer box.
  - Impl: both badges → fixed 60×50 (matches chip width 60 = «a bit longer square»), layout switched from row to column (icon over text) so they fill a squarish box. Baked pos: `#hub-rank` left 278 width 60 (exact worth-chip column), `#hub-tier` left 585 width 60 (centred over hero, dropped translateX). style.css shared `.hub-rank,.hub-tier` block + baked-position rules. CSS-only (no HTML/JS change).
  - Verified: server :3010 serves `#hub-rank {left:278 width:60 height:50}` = same left+width as `#chip-worth {left:278 width:60}` (directly aligned column); `#hub-tier {left:585 width:60 height:50}` (same 60×50, centred over hero); `flex-direction: column` + icon `font-size: 22px` present. NOTE: 50px-tall hero badge sits over the hero's upper area — visual glance on localhost may want a top nudge.
  - Committed style.css + this log.
  - Status: DONE

- **Req #5** — Task (continuation of #4, same lock `football-mock:hero-rank-badge`). Make BOTH badges — collector `#hub-rank` («אספן…» over the cards) and hero rank `#hub-tier` — more pixel-art: less box, less text.
  - Approach: unified 8-bit emblem style on `.hub-rank, .hub-tier` — notched pixel corners (`clip-path` L-notch), hard 2-band fill via `--c1/--c2`, raised bevel (inset box-shadows), chunky bottom shadow kept via `filter: drop-shadow` (box-shadow is clipped by clip-path, so must use filter). Icon-forward: `.px-ic` big, tiny `.px-word`/`.px-sub`.
  - Less text: collector drops the «אספן » prefix → icon + one word (מתחיל/נפוץ/נדיר/אדיר/אגדי); hero drops the tier word → icon + sub-rank number only (tier read from icon+colour). `HUB_RANKS` → {ic,word}; renderHubStats + renderHubTier now set innerHTML (px-ic/px-word/px-sub); renderHubTier sets `--c1/--c2` (not inline background).
  - Verified: `node --check` OK; server :3010 boots; `/`+`client.js`=200; CSS has `clip-path: polygon` + `.px-ic` + `filter: drop-shadow(0 3px 0`; JS has {ic,word} HUB_RANKS + px-ic/px-word/px-sub innerHTML + `setProperty('--c1')`; 0 stale (old `.label`, old `box.style.background`). NOTE: pixel-art look (notched corners + bevel + emoji) still wants a browser/device glance — emoji glyphs stay smooth; pixel feel comes from the frame, not the icon.
  - Committed my 4 files only.
  - Status: DONE

- **Req #4** — Task assigned + LOCKED (`football-mock:hero-rank-badge`). Requirement: (a) add a small rank-progress badge ABOVE the hero in the hub, same size + position style as the `אספן אדיר` collector badge (`#hub-rank`) sitting over the cards; (b) each rank has 4 sub-ranks → progression ברונזה 1→ברונזה 2→…→ברונזה 4→כסף 1… (7 tiers × 4).
  - Design: driven by the football level (`window.SALTIZ_XP`/`levelFromXp`, client.js:760). 1 level = 1 sub-rank (Bronze1..4=lvl1..4, Silver1=lvl5, … Master4=lvl28+). Progress bar = XP-into-level `pct` (base=50·L·(L-1), span=100·L). Mirrors `#hub-rank` (worth-derived) pattern.
  - Files: index.html (new `#hub-tier` badge over hero + `data-tier` on rank tiles + subnote), client.js (`RANK_TIERS`/`rankTierFromLevel`/`currentXpState`/`renderHubTier`, call after renderHubXp; rank screen shows current division + highlights active tile), style.css (`.hub-tier` + baked pos over hero + `.rank-tier.on`).
  - Done:
    - Hero badge `#hub-tier` in index.html: pill mirrors `.hub-rank` (same font/padding/shadow) + slim bottom progress bar; baked at `left:615 top:60 translateX(-50%)` = centred over the hero, same top baseline as `#hub-rank` over the cards. Tier gradient set inline per tier.
    - JS: `renderHubTier()` fills icon+`ברונזה N`+bar; called after `renderHubXp()` (line ~711). Rank screen: `#rank-me-div` = live division (from level), `#rank-me-sub` = live global position, active `.rank-tier` gets `.on`; renamed `#rank-me-pos`→`#rank-me-div`, added `#rank-me-ic` (JS updated to match — 0 stale `rank-me-pos` refs).
    - Mapping VERIFIED via node: lvl1→ברונזה1, lvl4→ברונזה4, lvl5→כסף1, lvl28+→אלוף4(clamped). DEV_LOCAL xp1240→lvl5→כסף1.
  - Verified: `node --check` OK; server :3010 boots; `/`+`/client.js`=200; served HTML has `#hub-tier(-lbl/-fill)` + `#rank-me-div/ic/sub` + all 7 `data-tier`; JS has `RANK_TIERS`/`rankTierFromLevel`/`renderHubTier`/`renderRankMeDivision`. NOTE: no headless-DOM tool → visual placement (badge centred over hero, no clip/overlap) still wants a browser/device glance.
  - Committed my 4 files only; left parallel agent's untracked files alone.
  - Status: DONE

- **Req #3** — Task assigned + LOCKED (`football-mock:lobby-element-basis`). Requirement: for each main-lobby element (clubs, shop, news, rank) build the BASIS/scaffold UI, researched from how Brawl Stars / Fortnite / Roblox structure these screens. Features not yet available → label `בקרוב`. Also fix `#select-best-btn` ("בחר הכי טוב") which clips its text in its 110×32 box — shorten text / shrink / icon-only.
  - Context: fixed 900×415 logical-px hub stage (`public/style.css` "BAKED LOBBY LAYOUT" §1308+). Sub-screens `#news/#shop/#clubs/#arena` live in `public/index.html:159+` but were bare `.subpage-note` placeholders. Screen routing = `showScreen()` (client.js:569) + `[data-open-screen]` binders (client.js:1418). Rank = `#rank-btn` (client.js:1491) previously only toasted `/handle-friends/rank`; no screen.
  - Research (WebSearch): SHOP = BrawlStars/Fortnite → wallet + daily-deal(24h timer) + featured bundle + category tiles. CLUBS = BrawlStars → «not-in-club» landing (create/find) + preview of chat/club-league(2wk)/roles(נשיא·סגן·בכיר·חבר). NEWS = Fortnite → featured MOTD banner + feed of update cards. RANK = BrawlStars trophy/ranked → live global position + tier ladder Bronze→כסף→זהב→יהלום→מיתי→אגדי→אלוף.
  - Done:
    - `#select-best-btn` text `בחר הכי טוב`→`הכי טוב` (fits 110×32 box; title attr keeps full meaning). index.html.
    - Rebuilt `#news`,`#shop`,`#clubs` subpage bodies + NEW `#rank` screen in index.html (RTL, all-`בקרוב` where unbuilt; 16 `בקרוב` pills total).
    - client.js: registered `rank` screen (line ~1414 loop); `#rank-btn` now `showScreen('rank')` + fills live `#rank-me-pos/#rank-me-sub` from `/handle-friends/rank`; added shop daily-deal countdown ticker to next local midnight (`#shop-daily-timer`).
    - style.css: new "LOBBY SUB-SCREEN BASIS" block after `.subpage-note` — `.soon-pill` + news/shop/clubs/rank component styles, matching the chunky dark-green pixel language.
  - Verified: `node --check` public/client.js + server.js OK; server boots :3010; `/ /client.js /style.css` = 200; served HTML has all 4 screen ids + `#shop-daily-timer` + `#rank-me-pos` + `<b>הכי טוב</b>`. NOTE: no headless-DOM tool here (smoke tests are WS-only) → the visual/no-clip pass still wants a browser/device check.
  - Committed only my 4 files (index.html, client.js, style.css, this log); left parallel agent's untracked `_test-dismiss.mjs` alone.
  - Status: DONE

- **Req #2** — Task assigned + LOCKED (`football-mock:hero-cosmetic-drag`). Requirement: hero outfit must be changeable by dragging a card (1) from the carousel and (2) from a power slot onto the hero; a power-slot card dropped on the hero changes the outfit but must NOT be removed from its slot.
  - Findings: 3 gesture binders in public/client.js — carousel `bindCarouselSwipe` (~839), album fan `bindFanDrag` (~1068), power slots `bindSlotDrag` (~1137). Hero re-skin = `setHeroSkinByRarity(rarity)` (line 63).
  - Carousel→hero ALREADY works (client.js:900). Power-slot→hero was BROKEN: dropping a slot card anywhere outside a slot (incl. the hero) hit `setSlotCard(srcSlot,null)` and REMOVED it (client.js:1180).
  - Fix: teach `bindSlotDrag` about the hero drop zone → re-skin + keep the card; only remove when dropped off both slots AND hero.
  - Change applied to public/client.js (`bindSlotDrag`, ~1141/1174/1185): added `heroBtn`+`heroUnder`, hover highlight `hub-hero-over`, suppressed remove-ghost over hero, and on release drop-on-hero → `setHeroSkinByRarity(srcCard.r)` WITHOUT `setSlotCard(srcSlot,null)`.
  - Verified: `node --check` OK; server boots on :3010; `/` and `/client.js` return 200. Carousel→hero path unchanged (already worked, client.js:900). NOTE: pointer-drag gesture itself still wants a manual browser check (drag a filled power slot onto the big hero → outfit changes, card remains).
  - ⚠️ COLLISION: a parallel agent (`opus-build78`) ran `git add -A` at 16:19 and swept my uncommitted client.js edits into THEIR commit **95d2f9e** ("fix(field-builder)…"). My full hero-drag change IS committed and intact in HEAD — verified via `git show 95d2f9e -- public/client.js` — just under a misleading message. Did NOT rewrite history (opus-build78 still active). If a clean standalone commit is wanted later, cherry-pick just the `bindSlotDrag` hunk.
  - Status: DONE (code live on branch feat/build-bomb-cancel @ 95d2f9e)

- **Req #1** — Session start. Ground rules set: work in localhost, commit everything, log every request here for handoff, short-bullet answers. Task not yet assigned; awaiting task, will lock it on receipt.
  - State at start: branch `feat/build-bomb-cancel`, working tree clean.
  - Status: WAITING FOR TASK

- **Hero-custom rework (agent `hero-custom`)** — 6-part wardrobe/picker task. Locks held: `football-mock:hero-picker` + `football-mock/server.js`. Built + verified LIVE on :3012 (I restarted `node server.js` PORT=3012 → new pid; HTTP 200, boot clean).
  - 1. Big centre hero paints IN FRONT of both rails, never clipped — `style.css` `.wardrobe .wr-center/.pick-preview` z-index 4 + `overflow:visible`, rails z1.
  - 2. Removed the picker Save button (`#pick-save` gone from index.html); every hero/costume tap now AUTO-SAVES (`commit()` on each select; outside-click just closes). Note: `#b-save`/`#ce-save` are other screens — untouched.
  - 3. Hero order stays rarity striker→alien (already `HERO_KEYS` order); preserved through the gating changes.
  - 4. Hero unlock gating: every 7 DISTINCT owned cards opens the next hero — `client.js` `distinctOwnedCount`/`unlockedHeroCount`/`isHeroUnlocked` (floor(distinct/7)+1, capped 9). Locked heroes not selectable (toast hint); on open, a locked saved hero clamps to best-unlocked.
  - 5. Locked heroes render as a dark shadow + 🔒 badge — `style.css` `.pick-hero.locked`.
  - 6. **server.js** bot draw capped to the highest hero tier any human in the room wears (`botCosmeticForRoom`), uniform striker..cap, 1/20 one tier above (clamped alien). Wired into `computeBotPlan` + `fillBots` fallback. Unit-tested (dist ~4.8% above-cap) + play-smoke on throwaway :3010 (match started, 355 frames, no errors). `test-cosmetics.mjs` still 7/7.
  - ⚠️ COEXISTENCE (NOT committed): the working tree already held **bots-xp's** uncommitted XP-driven-bots work in `server.js`, `public/client.js`, `shared/difficulty.js` (RARITY_BY_LEVEL, quickMatch, bot level badge) AND another agent's `#cards` layout fixes in `public/style.css`. My edits sit cleanly ON TOP (node --check + smoke both green). I deliberately did NOT `git commit` — a pathspec commit would sweep bots-xp's + the cards agent's in-flight work (the known footgun). All my changes are live on :3012 from disk. Whoever commits should do it deliberately, per-hunk.
  - Status: DONE (live on :3012, intentionally uncommitted pending owners of the co-touched files).
